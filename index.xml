      <description>For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.</description>

      <description>Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job. Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark. Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.</description>

      <description>Description: Fast Iron is creating a &amp;ldquo;blue book for bull dozers,&amp;rdquo; for customers to value what their heavy equipment fleet is worth at auction. The goal of the Project is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equipment at auction based on it&amp;rsquo;s usage, equipment type, and configuaration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.
